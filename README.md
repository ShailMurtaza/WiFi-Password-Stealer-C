# WiFi Password Stealer C

This program will fetch saved Passwords of WiFi from Windows and save them to Window.txt file
I have added compiled file into repository so you can use it without compiling

WiFi-Password-Stealer.c will crash if passwords are more than 10 so it is better to use UPDATED versions
